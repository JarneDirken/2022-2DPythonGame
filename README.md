# 🥷🏽 2D game in python.

Just a simple 2D game in python to get a better understanding of the programming language

## 📦 Technologies

- `Python`

## 🦄 Features

Here's what you can do with my game:

- **Move and stay alive**: Try to stay alive by dodging the enemies!

- **Kill enemies**: Kill enemies to get a higher score.

## 👩🏽‍🍳 The Process

For this straightforward project, my aim was to enhance my comprehension of Python. What could be more effective than creating a 2D game in Python?

All the details are extensively explained in my YouTube video, accessible through the link in this GitHub repository (the video is in Dutch). To briefly summarize:

I initiated the project by conducting thorough research on Python game development. Following that, I conceptualized a simple yet engaging game idea.

Subsequently, I acquired the necessary assets for the game. Finally, I delved into coding, ensuring that everything seamlessly came together.

In essence, it was an enriching project that significantly contributed to the enhancement of my Python programming skills.

## 📚 What I Learned

During this project, I've improved python and problem solving skills.

### 🧠 Brain:

- **Problem solving**: First time making a game in python. This game with a fare share of bugs and problems.

### ⌚ Time management:

- **Using scrum board**: Keeping track of all my tasks using a scrum board really made everything organised. For this project I used Trello.

### 📓 New knowledge:

- **Python**: Not the first time using python but this definitely more advanced then before.

### 📈 Overall Growth:

This project helped me get an idea of how to start a project. Start with research, write everything down in steps and start working step by step.
